All About Andrew Gubanov
<hr>
</h1>
<br>
<p> My name is Andrew Gubanov and I enjoy engineering of all sorts. Whether it be cars, computers, or robotics, all of it interests me. I am on the swim team and the robotics team which you can visit <a href="http://www.walpolerobotics.org/">here</a>.

<p> This is my first car, I purchased it a couple months ago. It is a 2007 Subaru Legacy with a manual transmission. While most people might think it is just a plain old Subaru, I see it as a fun, but still reliable and safe car. It has plenty of room to move people and things but still sporty enough to be interesting to drive. Especially since it is a manual transmission which makes driving the car much more involved, as well as increasing my MPG.
 It's also AWD, meaning all four wheels are being powered by the engine. And as long as I have good tires the snow or mud will be easy to conquer.</p>
